# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game, made with React.
I also used:

- Sass for it's nesting capabilities and use of variables, functions and mixins
- TypeScript to enhance code quality and maintainability by adding static typing
- Vite for fast and efficient development

## Run the app locally

- Open up a terminal
- `cd` into the folder where you want to save the repo
- Run `git clone https://github.com/DevFox1337/tic-tac-toe-react.git` to copy the project to your machine
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server and have a look
